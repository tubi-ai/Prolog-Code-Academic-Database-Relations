Objective:
The Prolog code defines an academic database for a university setting, capturing relationships between instructors, students, courses, and departments. The code contains a series of facts and rules that model the associations between these entities, allowing queries to extract relevant information about which courses are taught, which students are enrolled, and the departmental affiliations of individuals.

Facts:
The facts in the code represent static information about the university’s academic structure, including who the instructors and students are, what courses are available, and which courses are taught by each instructor.

Instructors:

instructor(jane)., instructor(tom)., instructor(john)., instructor(kelly).
Students:

student(christy)., student(angelica)., student(hans)., student(annabel).
student(jerry)., student(kristin)., student(bill).
Courses and Departments:

The course/2 fact connects departments with specific courses.
Example: course(cs, cs303). indicates that cs303 is a course in the cs (Computer Science) department.
Departments represented include cs (Computer Science), ee (Electrical Engineering), and ie (Industrial Engineering).
Teaching Assignments:

The teach/2 fact indicates which instructors teach specific courses.
Example: teach(jane, cs303). indicates that Jane teaches the course cs303.
Student Enrollment:

The enrolled/2 fact connects students with the courses they are enrolled in.
Example: enrolled(christy, cs303). indicates that Christy is enrolled in cs303.
Rules:
The rules define relationships between entities based on the facts provided. These rules allow for more complex queries that derive implicit knowledge from the explicit facts.

coursesTaught/2:

Purpose: Determines which courses are taught by a specific instructor.
Rule: coursesTaught(X,Y) :- instructor(X), course(Z, Y), teach(X,Y).
This rule checks if a person is an instructor, and if they teach a course in any department.
coursesTaken/2:

Purpose: Determines which courses a specific student is enrolled in.
Rule: coursesTaken(X,Y) :- student(X), course(Z, Y), enrolled(X,Y).
This rule checks if a person is a student and if they are enrolled in any course.
department/2:

Purpose: Identifies the department(s) associated with an individual (student or instructor).
Rule: department(X,Y) :- (coursesTaken(X,Z); coursesTaught(X,Z)), course(Y,Z).
The rule combines both teaching and enrollment information to determine a person’s department.
studentOf/2:

Purpose: Determines if a student is taught by a particular instructor.
Rule: studentOf(X,Y) :- coursesTaken(X,Z), teach(Y,Z).
This rule checks if a student is enrolled in any course taught by a specific instructor.
instructorOf/2:

Purpose: Determines if an instructor has a specific student in any of their courses.
Rule: instructorOf(X,Y) :- coursesTaught(X,Z), enrolled(Y,Z).
This rule checks if an instructor teaches any courses in which a particular student is enrolled.
Queries and Their Outputs:
The code is designed to answer various queries about the relationships between students, instructors, courses, and departments. Here are some examples:

Courses Taken by Bill:

Query: ?- coursesTaken(bill,Y)
Output: cs102, cs104, cs332
Explanation: Bill is enrolled in these three courses.
Bill’s Enrollment in cs102:

Query: ?- coursesTaken(bill, cs102)
Output: true
Explanation: Bill is indeed enrolled in cs102.
Jerry’s Department:

Query: ?- department(jerry,Y)
Output: ee
Explanation: All courses Jerry is enrolled in belong to the ee (Electrical Engineering) department.
Courses Taught by John:

Query: ?- coursesTaught(john,Y)
Output: cs104, cs332, ee432
Explanation: John teaches these three courses.
Is Christy a Student of Jane?

Query: ?- studentOf(christy,jane)
Output: true
Explanation: Christy is enrolled in at least one course taught by Jane.
Students Taught by Tom:

Query: ?- instructorOf(tom,Y)
Output:
Tom teaches angelica, kristin, and jerry in various courses.
The query produces multiple outputs as Tom teaches multiple students in different courses.
Instructors and Their Students:

Query: ?- instructorOf(M,Y)
Output: A detailed list showing each instructor (M) and their corresponding students (Y).
Explanation: This query gives a comprehensive mapping of which instructors teach which students.
Conclusion:
This Prolog code effectively models an academic database by using facts to define static relationships and rules to derive more complex associations. It demonstrates the power of logic programming in querying and inferring relationships within structured data, providing a robust framework for answering various questions about courses, departments, and the interactions between students and instructors.

The code contains a series of facts and rules that model the associations between these entities, allowing queries to extract relevant information about which courses are taught, which students are enrolled, and the departmental affiliations of individuals. ### **Facts:** The facts in the code represent static information about the university’s academic structure, including who the instructors and students are, what courses are available, and which courses are taught by each instructor. - **Instructors:** - `instructor(jane).`, `instructor(tom).`, `instructor(john).`, `instructor(kelly).` - **Students:** - `student(christy).`, `student(angelica).`, `student(hans).`, `student(annabel).` - `student(jerry).`, `student(kristin).`, `student(bill).` - **Courses and Departments:** - The `course/2` fact connects departments with specific courses. - Example: `course(cs, cs303).` indicates that `cs303` is a course in the `cs` (Computer Science) department. - Departments represented include `cs` (Computer Science), `ee` (Electrical Engineering), and `ie` (Industrial Engineering). - **Teaching Assignments:** - The `teach/2` fact indicates which instructors teach specific courses. - Example: `teach(jane, cs303).` indicates that Jane teaches the course `cs303`. - **Student Enrollment:** - The `enrolled/2` fact connects students with the courses they are enrolled in. - Example: `enrolled(christy, cs303).` indicates that Christy is enrolled in `cs303`. ### **Rules:** The rules define relationships between entities based on the facts provided.
